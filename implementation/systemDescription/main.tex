\subsection{How the system is tied together}
First off the operating system needs to be installed, which in this case is Debian Squeeze. When this was installed by the OS-group and when we had obtained our usernames with shell and root access, the installation of the services could begin. The first packages to be installed was MySQL, NGINX and PHP. The MySQL installation were supposed to be done by the Gaming-group, but since we were dependent on MySQL to get MediaWiki up and running, we chose to install it and let the Gaming-group configure it later on. All these packages were easy to install with aptitude.

The MediaWiki was dependent on MySQL and PHP to run since it needs somewhere to store data and because it is written in PHP. Therefore MediaWiki was the last thing to install. To install it you download it to the desired folder, extract and install it from the browser.

At last we had to fix all the configuration files and create user spaces for personal websites. All of this is explained how to do in the installation guide in chapter 3.
